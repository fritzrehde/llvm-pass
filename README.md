# LLVM Passes

This repo contains some LLVM passes I have written while learning LLVM.

## Passes

Name | Description
:-- | :--
[Hello World](hello-world) | Print out the name and number of arguments of non-external functions that exist in the program; no modification of the program
<!-- [Dead Code Elimination](dead-code-elimination) | Remove code that does not affect the program result (i.e. that has no side effects and no usages) -->
